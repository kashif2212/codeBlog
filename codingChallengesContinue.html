                <p>A great way to improve your skills when learning to code is by solving coding challenges. Solving
                    different types of challenges and puzzles can help you become a better problem solver, learn the
                    intricacies of a programming language, prepare for job interviews, learn new algorithms, and more.
                </p>
                <p>This blog will help you know about the coding Challenges going on all over the world. Some of them are listed below</p>

                    from the past that you can complete on your own directly online using their code editor. Their
                    popular Single Round Matches are offered a few times per month at a specific time where you compete
                    against others to solve challenges the fastest with the best score.

                            rel="noopener">example</a>). The challenges range from easy (finding the largest word in a

                    <p>They also provide a collection of <a

                <p>Project Euler provides a large collection of challenges in the domain of computer science and
                    mathematics. The challenges typically involve writing a small program to figure out the solution to
                    a clever mathematical formula or equation, such as <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=551"
                        rel="noopener">finding the sum of digits</a> of all numbers preceding each number in a series.
                </p>
                <p>You cannot directly code on the website in an editor, so you would need to write a solution on your

                    They provide a discussion and leaderboard for every challenge, and most challenges come with an
                    editorial that explains more about the challenge and how to approach it to come up with a solution.
                    Aside from the editorial, you cannot currently view the solutions of other users on HackerRank.</p>
                <p>HackerRank also provides the ability for users to <a

                <p>It is a bit different from other challenge websites, however, because you work with a mentor after

                    needed. Once your answers have been approved and submitted, you unlock more challenges.</p>
